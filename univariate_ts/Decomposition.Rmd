Time series decomposition involves thinking of a series as a combination of level, trend, seasonality, and noise components. It's useful because it provides abstractions which helps to give a clearer view of what's going on. It helps in interpretation. 

A given time series is thought to consist of three __systematic components__ and 1 __non-systematic component__. These __systematic components__ have consistency and can be described or modeled. The __non-systematic component__ cannot be directly modeled. To recap, a time series is compiled of:

* __level__: the average value in the series
* __Trend__: The increasing or decreasing value in the series.
* __Seasonality__: The repeating short-term cycle in the series.
* __Noise__: The random variation in the series.
