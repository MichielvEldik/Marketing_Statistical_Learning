A so-called *lag operator* or *backward shift operator* is defined as:
$$B^kX_t = X_{t-k}$$
Where:
* k = the amount of steps back we take
* t = time lag

In time series analysis, the lag operator (L) or backshift operator (B) operates on an element of time series to produce the previous element. When writing the equation for a model with a bunch of lags, it's going to require a lot of writing! We use the lag operator form to shorten the equations. Imagine we have an ARMA(3, 3) model. That would require the following equation:
$$y_t = \varphi_1 y_{t-1} +  \varphi_2 y_{t-2} +  \varphi_3 y_{t-3}  +  \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} + \theta_3 y_{t-3} + \varepsilon_t$$
It can be written as where (L) summarizes the lag operations. 
$$\Phi(L^3)y_t = \Theta(L^3) \varepsilon_t$$

In this case, $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ represent the following:
$$\Phi = (1 - \varphi_1L -\varphi_2L^2 - \varphi_3L^3)y_t$$
$$\Theta = (1 + \theta_1L + \theta_2L^2 + \theta_3L^3)\varepsilon_t$$
