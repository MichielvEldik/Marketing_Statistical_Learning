THe Cross correlation function shows the measure of similarity of two seperate time series as a function of the displacement (lag) of one relative to the other. 


It's an extension of the ACF to multiple series. The interpretation is actually quite similar:

* Spikes means moving average behaviour
* Decay means autoregressive behaviour

## Important

The __ARIMA(p, d, q)__ structure of the equations depends on included x-variables.

E.g., sales series showing seasonality will require different ARIMA structure depending on whether or not accounted for in the model by a seasonal effect variable(s).
