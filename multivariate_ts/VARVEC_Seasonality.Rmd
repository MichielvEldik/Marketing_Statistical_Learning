## __Seasonality in VAR and VEC__

It's typical marketing series to show seasonal patterns.

How to deal with that?

### __De-seasonalize__
* Typical for macro-economics
* Seasonality seens as contamination of "true" series
* Many drawbacks

In marketing, we don't deseasonalize but control for it in our models.

### __Add seasonal control variables__

These seasonal patterns are part of reality. We should not dismiss them.

We have specified a sine and cosine function to be included. It's an elegant way of controlling for seasonality effects, only __consumes 2 degrees of freedom__.

* Sine = high in spring, low in autumn
* Cosine = high in winter, low in summer
