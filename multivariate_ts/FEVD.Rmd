## __FEVD Basic Idea__
Forecast Error Variance Decomposition

What part of the forecast error variance in an endogenous variable is due to

    * Own past shocks to that endogenous variable?
    * All past shocks to the other endogenous variables?
    
Shows the relative importance of all the endogenous variables in contributing to the variation in the focal endogenous variable.
